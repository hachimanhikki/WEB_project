I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car;
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy;
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face."
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's stores
Buys a twenty-carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And when he gives it to her she begins to sing

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on
